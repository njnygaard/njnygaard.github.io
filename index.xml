      <title>Fermented Hot Sauce</title>

      <description>I got a pretty nice flush of chilies with the garden this year. As they all ripen in a few waves, I need to figure out something to do with two waves of perfect chilies. They taste great on their own but as I&amp;rsquo;m the only one in the house with a sufficiently deadened tongue, I need to preserve them.
Pat recommended a fermented hot sauce and that sounds right up my alley.</description>

      <title>Arch Upgrade Postgres</title>

      <description>I upgraded Postgres on my Arch box accidentally. Unfortunately it was a major version so I can&amp;rsquo;t get any of that data. You could do a downgrade if your package cache is intact.
sudo pacman -U file:///var/cache/pacman/pkg/postgresql-13.6-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst; sudo pacman -U file:///var/cache/pacman/pkg/postgresql-libs-13.6-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst; But you&amp;rsquo;ll run in to library issues because you&amp;rsquo;re on a rolling release and old versions are for chumps.

      <description>This was a wonderful experiment for the 113°F Phoenix summer. My FiL got an automated garden for Christmas and has been growing mint like crazy. He warned me about it taking over my raised planter and I dismissed that because I love mint. Naturally, it took over half of it and had to be dealt with. I harvested half of it which yielded 250g of mint leaves. In retrospect, I could easily have doubled the mint quantity in this recipe.</description>

      <description>Motivation It would be really cool to have Neovim work like Foam and get away from VSCode. I was partially inspired by Cool desktops don’t change 😎. The article worried me about the collapse of Atom and what that might mean for VSCode.
Caveats I used Neovim and it is aliased to vi on my system. I&amp;rsquo;m not confusing the various projects (Neovim, Vim, vi, ed). vi is just very satisfying to type.</description>

      <description>I was looking on the map for something to do and I found a fucking Golden Spiral in the middle of the city. Done deal. Let&amp;rsquo;s walk there.
Pilot Butte I like the look of the track generated for walking up Pilot Butte. It&amp;rsquo;s an old Cinder Cone and it is like a perfect pimple. There are trails that take a more direct path up, but the road follows the satisfying curve you see in the track.</description>

      <description>I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a good source for this information in one place, that&amp;rsquo;s a dead giveaway that I should be writing an article.
Some meta discussion, it looks like I&amp;rsquo;ve been away a while and that&amp;rsquo;s because I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a organizing my cookbook. I used to just post recipes here (in the &amp;lsquo;before times&amp;rsquo;) but I&amp;rsquo;ve found that I hate using a digital device when I need to reference a recipe in the heat of the moment.</description>

      <description>This is just a classic. I would hesitate to call this a recipe and really more of a &amp;lsquo;method&amp;rsquo;. This is really about getting as much beef in your mouth as you can and extending that experience with potatoes and carrots.
Ingredient Quantity Butter 4 Tablespoons Beef, Chuck 4lbs whole Baking Powder 1 Tablespoon, For Dusting Onion, White 1 Large Celery 3 Large Stalks Garlic 1 Head, All Cloves Carrots 2 Large Carrots 3 Large Little Potatoes 20 Small Bay Leaves 4 Fresh Soy Sauce 1/4 Cup Apple Cider Vinegar 2 Tablespoons Thyme Lots of sprigs Chipotle Chiles 2 Tomato Paste 2 Tablespoons Bone Broth 1 Quart Wine 1 Cup Fire Roasted Canned Diced Tomatoes 2 14oz Cans Instant Pot 1 Procedure Firstly, let your beef come to room temperature.</description>

      <description>First post of the New Year. Still got it in January. I moved States, bought a house, got a dog. So blogging has not been at the top of the list.
Now that I emptied my storage unit, I found my old buddy Tinman. He&amp;rsquo;s a Core i7 &amp;lsquo;server&amp;rsquo; with two GTX 480&amp;rsquo;s and 2TB of space. He&amp;rsquo;s old, but sturdy. He deserves a place of glory. And and Arch installation.</description>

      <description>Glad I found this one in my drafts and completed the photos. We had a lot of fun camping out there. A little cold but I bought a quilted thermal jacket and some wool socks from Walmart that really seemed to take the edge off.
Not much of an interesting elevation profile from the GPS, but I think I was just experimenting with it then. This was a car camping trip so we just did some wandering and we drove both ways.</description>

      <description>I proposed to my wife in Kauai at the Waimea Canyon Lookout. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have picked a better spot. Actually, I did. When we did the hike I picked the first spot you see here. You can see in the Google Earth picture the more teal trace as it curve along the rim. These two pictures are of that first spot. The &amp;lsquo;real&amp;rsquo; spot.
However, in the following two, you can see the &amp;lsquo;real real&amp;rsquo; spot.</description>

      <description>This is Convict Lake. I grew coming here to hike and camp. My two fondest birthday celebrations have been at this lake. The first with my parents for my 12th birthday. The second with my parents and now wife for my 35th birthday.
Description AllTrails Description
This hike only takes a couple hours or so. It is nothing too strenuous, just a nice loop around the lake. That purple area extends further in to the mountain during summer.</description>

      <title>Extending GPG Expiry</title>
      <link>https://www.nygaard.site/post/0051-extending-gpg-expiry/</link>

      <guid>https://www.nygaard.site/post/0051-extending-gpg-expiry/</guid>
      <description>If you followed my last article on this subject, you have a GPG setup without the master private key on your computer. You also put an expiration date on that key. When your key expires, it can no longer be used to encrypt data for you. It can however still decrypt messages from prior to the expiry date. This does not help in the situation where your private key is compromised.</description>

      <description>Ash has been wanting these for 2 months. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t say no when we were going to be using the Traeger anyways.
Ingredient Quantity Jalapeños 18 Medium Thin-Cut Bacon 1 Pack Cream Cheese 8-10 Oz (room temperature) Colby Jack 4 Oz Chili Powder 1 tsp Granulated Garlic 1 tsp Salt 1 tsp Scallions 2 minced Procedure Split the jalapeños lengthwise. I liked splitting them through the stem so that they had little handles.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s better than a BBQ on a National Holiday?
I used the Traeger for some St. Louis cut ribs. This recipe was crazy simple. Like shamefully simple. Mostly I just want to get in the habit of updating my blog, so this is what you get.
Ingredient Quantity St. Louis Ribs 2 Racks Favorite Rub Lots Texas Blend Traeger Pellets At least 2 hoppers worth Oh yeah, you&amp;rsquo;ll need a Traeger too.</description>

      <guid>https://www.nygaard.site/post/0048-questions-in-arch/</guid>
      <description>I notice myself asking questions about common tasks when I come back to Arch after a long time. I think that makes for a good article as it is possible others have these questions.
I&amp;rsquo;m running out of space and that&amp;rsquo;s stupid.
Not a question, but I&amp;rsquo;ve felt that exact sentiment.
In Arch, this is very likely the Pacman cache going crazy. Every time you upgrade a package in Pacman, it keeps the previous version.</description>

      <guid>https://www.nygaard.site/post/0046-bone-broth/</guid>
      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t really like the distinction between &amp;lsquo;bone broth&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;stock&amp;rsquo; because they&amp;rsquo;re the same thing if done right. The distinction is useful because the product that is called stock in a grocery store is very different. Useful, but different.
Bone broth is gelatinous at fridge temperature. This is because you cook down the bones and connective tissue over a long period of time. Collagen is converted to gelatin and you get meat/bone jello.</description>

      <description>I encountered some issues running WebStorm and I think I finally solved them. This was an annoying bug that was a mix of WebStorm and OSX behavior that I didn&amp;rsquo;t ask for.
TODO: Pinentry Image
This is the prompt that you get on OSX running Pinentry. I was getting this randomly all throughout the day just running JetBrains products. That&amp;rsquo;s really annoying. You can see that WebStorm is trying to run git-upload-pack when I get the Pinentry prompt, and that is what triggered it.</description>

      <title>GPG for SSH</title>

      <guid>https://www.nygaard.site/post/0041-gpg-for-ssh/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m using the gpg-agent in place of the ssh-agent. I think this is a very interesting use because it eliminates the need for me to store my ssh key as a flat file:
ssh-add -l 4096 SHA256:rsOIZD3XP+Tvj+l5xrbRnxgvdg2qKL5agAxzPLT5rao (none) (RSA) 2048 SHA256:U6ETCKbdPbvgPMSjePS0jrGR3yMdhF9NC6MUHItynJc /Users/admin/.ssh/splice-dcos.pem (RSA) ... You can see here that the top key is one that is generated by GPG and not associated with any particular file. That being said, I still have to use SSH keys that are given to me for work.</description>

Format I&amp;rsquo;ll save you the explanation of what GPG is. First thing I needed was a USB stick that would be compatible with Arch and MacOS. This fight is always interesting and I would rank the better operating system as the one that can compromise on the filesystem. Naturally, insert the USB stick in the MacOS and format it as a Journaled HFS+ partition because we can install the driver on Arch.</description>

They had a feature about what to pack if you have to go cook somewhere. I liked the list and I want to keep it for myself on the public internet.</description>

      <description>This seems to be a bit of a nightmare with Arch. I think the issue is that it is difficult to test. I typically connect to pretty good networks that have passwords and reasonable security. On vacation though, I don&amp;rsquo;t have a choice of what to connect to. I really don&amp;rsquo;t know what the advantage of WPA Enterprise is with the stupid login page. There is no way that is more secure.</description>

      <description>Before going on, make sure you meet the requirements:
General recommendations after an Arch install can be found here. I&amp;rsquo;m going to use this article to collect my list of requirements.
Okay, you have to install sudo. You also need a user. And a sudo group. Use visudo to edit the sudoers file. groupadd sudo will add the sudo group. Then you can gpasswd -a drone sudo to add drone to the sudo group.</description>

      <description>I wanted to install Arch because all the cool kids do it. Really, what I wanted was more control over the system and the decisions I had to make to get it to work. In the past, I have favored speed of installation and stability of the installation because I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to spend time configuring stuff that didn&amp;rsquo;t relate to what I wanted to accomplish. That basically means LTS Ubuntu.</description>

      <description>Andy&amp;rsquo;s one of my best friends. He&amp;rsquo;s also a Vietnamese guy. He makes delicious dishes and during our time as roommates, he expanded my knowledge of ingredients. He introduced me to fish sauce and it&amp;rsquo;s role in savory dishes. Also, how it should never be left to roll around in the back of your car.
Ingredient Quantity Chicken Breast, Roasted 10 oz Butter, Salted 1 Tablespoon Onion, Chopped 1 Medium Sugar (optional) 1 Teaspoon Fish Sauce 2 Tablespoons Better than Bullion, Chicken 1 Tablespoon Okra, Sliced, Wheels 40 Pods Cilantro Handful Green Onion, Chopped Handful Water / Chicken Broth Lots Start by frying your pan ingredients together in the bottom of a heavy pot.</description>

      <description>Motivation I wanted to get my environment ready for Android development. It was pretty straightforward on the Mac, I can see it being more of a headache on other platforms.
Procedure Firstly, download Android Studio. It is pretty amazing that they&amp;rsquo;ve wrapped everything you need in a free IDE. There&amp;rsquo;s a ton of shit for Java projects that I&amp;rsquo;d rather not think about.
I&amp;rsquo;m using this training course. Open it in another tab.</description>

      <description>Fuck yo tongue.
Ingredient Quantity Chilies Tub `O Break the ends off the chilies and throw away any mushy or moldy ones. Lovingly slice them in half lengthwise. You could take the time to seed them, but that kinda defeats the purpose of making your own ridiculously hot crushed peppers.
Use gloves if you like to touch yourself.</description>

      <description>Basics with Babish did pizza dough this week. I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting for Sunday all week because of that.
He mentions that the recipe is Jim Lahey&amp;rsquo;s overnight pizza dough. The recipe looks super simple and I love the fact that everything is listed in grams. Baking is science and that&amp;rsquo;s usually why I don&amp;rsquo;t do it. I don&amp;rsquo;t really like following directions in the kitchen, but I can make an exception for pizza.</description>

      <description>I spend a lot of time thinking about protein. I get about 120g per day which is almost the minimum for my weight. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen articles recommending 1-1.5g of protein per pound of bodyweight when you&amp;rsquo;re active. Because I weigh 244lbs (today), and my goal is 200lbs, I think I should just target the goal weight quantity.
So, let&amp;rsquo;s do some chicken this week. That&amp;rsquo;ll help right? Of course, Kenji&amp;rsquo;s got me covered.</description>

      <description>That mini-muffin pan is one of the best weight-loss buys I&amp;rsquo;ve made. 24 little slots to fill with goodness. I haven&amp;rsquo;t ever used it for muffins though. Because muffins suck. Meatballs win every time.
These things are fun too. Some eggs and some low cal sausage and you have little breakfast party bites that run about 29 calories a pop.
Go get these things:
Ingredient Quantity Eggs 4 Egg Whites 4 Red Bell Pepper 1 Mushrooms 11 Green Onions 6ish?</description>

      <description>Ingredient Quantity Tomatillos 6 Jalapeños 3 Garlic 5 Cloves Onion 1/2 Large Pork Juice Whatever you got This salsa comes from the desire to use the rendered pork juices from the carnitas. I decided to make it a separate recipe because I might want to modify it in the future.
Roast the red ingredients on the grill until their skins are charred. Remove any stems you can.
Throw your blue ingredients in to the blender with the roasted red ingredients.</description>

      <description>Kenji seems to have superpowers. I like everything I&amp;rsquo;ve made with his guidance, and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that this is no exception. I love me some carnitas and I think that trimming off the fat will fit well in my diet.
I found 16 lbs of Pork Butt (Shoulder) at Costco. Only when I got home did I realize that it might have been a bit of overkill. I put half in the freezer for some other adventure.</description>

      <description>This is my standard Gumbo. Alton Brown posted a recipe for inspiration, but I really just do whatever I feel like. I feel like I can deviate a bit because I don&amp;rsquo;t have a Bayou Grandma to yell at me. I&amp;rsquo;m not about to go hunting for filè powder when I&amp;rsquo;m cooking for the week.
Ingredient Quantity Flour, Wheat, All Purpose 4 Tablespoons Butter, Salted 4 Tablespoons Onion, Yellow, Chopped 1 Cup Garlic, Clove, Halved 6 Peppers, Bell, Medium, Diced 2 Celery, Diced 1 Cup Red Chili Flakes some Granulated Garlic some Cumin some Celery Salt some Black Pepper lots Smoked Paprika some Stock, Chicken 2 Cups Tomatoes, Diced, No Salt 4 Cups Okra, Wheels 4 Cups Basil Leaves 12 Make your roux first with the red ingredients.</description>

      <description>Zapier Zapier gives me a list of things that I will need to configure for the zapier app to be able to communicate with my app vi OAuth. I think this is a good way to call out the routes I need to build.

      <description>Okay this is my first foray in to AppleScript, and I have to say that I don&amp;rsquo;t hate it. I wanted a way to take screenshots directly in to Preview on my Mac.
Turns out that the screenshot utility is available on the command line:
&amp;gt; screencapture -h screencapture: illegal option -- h usage: screencapture [-icMPmwsWxSCUtoa] [files] -c force screen capture to go to the clipboard -b capture Touch Bar - non-interactive modes only .</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s say you want to know if your boss is away on vacation next week. So you call their admin and say &amp;ldquo;Can you double-check that my phone number is correct if the Boss is out next week?&amp;rdquo;.
They load up the boss&amp;rsquo; calendar to check and based on his presence next week then load up your info.
Only once done, do they take the time to remember the boss didn&amp;rsquo;t want you to know wether they are in or out.</description>

      <description>Background Zapier is effectively a task runner. Integrating with them would put FlowMojo in a marketplace of other productivity applications. I think it will really fuel adoption. To get in the door with Zapier, I need to become an OAuth provider.
You can create a Zapier Application for your WebApp and give that to Zapier. Then, your users that also have Zapier accounts can go to Zapier and choose to make a &amp;lsquo;Zap&amp;rsquo; with the Zapier Application you created.</description>

      <description>I made a resolution that I would make public contributions on GitLab and GitHub this year. The easiest way to do that is to make blog posts because both of these repos are public (because the site is public 😜). My site is a GitLab repo with a GitHub submodule repo. The GitLab repo contains the Hugo project and the theme Blackburn. The GitHub repo is the output of the hugo project and exists at the conventional place you would deploy a personal GitHub page.</description>

      <description>I wanted to switch to i3, a tiling window manager. There are some things that are better, and some things that I miss. I run Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Unity provides a lot of functionality that makes using the computer effortless. The motivation for using i3 is that, while developing, I end up tiling all my windows in separate workspaces anyways. It seems like the natural functionality of i3 better fits my use-case.</description>

      <title>AWS Instance Resiliency</title>

      <description>I recently discovered that changing the size of and EC2 instance does not destroy the EBS volume associated with it. Let that sink in. You have a computer sitting on your desk serving your website. You realize that you&amp;rsquo;re spending too much money on electricity for this computer, so while it is running, you rip the hard drive out and put it in another computer. In 5 seconds, your website is still running.</description>

There&amp;rsquo;s also my preferred email attached to that public key.</description>

      <title>Wordpress TLS</title>
      <link>https://www.nygaard.site/post/0007-wordpress-tls/</link>

      <description>Background I needed to get a Wordpress site working for my side project. The installation process is all fine and dandy, until you want to do the right thing and enforce TLS for your site. I ran in to issues with mixed-content errors. Wordpress was requesting jQuery and some CSS files over the insecure routes to my domain.
Attempted Solutions I had a redirect block in my nginx configuration, but that did not seem to solve the issue.</description>

      <description>I interviewed today with LinkedIn and [REDACTED]. He was intimidatingly knowledgeable and described a work environment that I really hope to join. I hope that I have the skill set necessary.
What follows are notes of the responses for my edification, not necessarily how I answered.
Describe what happens when we type ssh shell.linkedin.com and hit enter.
When you hit enter, your shell gets the string you entered on the command line.</description>

      <description>Detail and SSH connection Symmetrical Encryption One key can be used to encrypt messages Alice-&amp;gt;Bob but can also be used to decrypt messages Bob-&amp;gt;Alice. Anyone that holds the key, can encrypt and decrypt messages. AKA &amp;ldquo;Shared Secret&amp;rdquo; || &amp;ldquo;Secret Key&amp;rdquo; SSH uses Symmetrical encryption for the connection contrary to what most people believe (asymmetric). Asymmetric encryption is only used for authentication. Key Exchange Algorithm Using an algorithm, the client and server can exchange data over the Asymmetrically encrypted connection to arrive at a shared secret that can be used for the Symmetrically Encrypted connection.</description>

      <description>Hey hey! I got it to work! I&amp;rsquo;ll use this post to log what I had to do to get it to work.
Motivation I wanted a site for my personal use. I started off with a full stack deployed on AWS, but when your trial runs out, you can get hit with a pretty hefty usage.
That&amp;rsquo;s quite a bit of money for something that I really wanted as a note store.</description>
