      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s better than a BBQ on a National Holiday?
I used the Traeger for some St. Louis cut ribs. This recipe was crazy simple. Like shamefully simple. Mostly I just want to get in the habit of updating my blog, so this is what you get.
 Ingredient Quantity     St. Louis Ribs    2 Racks      Favorite Rub    Lots      Texas Blend Traeger Pellets    At least 2 hoppers worth      Oh yeah, you&amp;rsquo;ll need a Traeger too.</description>

      <description>Kenji seems to have superpowers. I like everything I&amp;rsquo;ve made with his guidance, and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that this is no exception. I love me some carnitas and I think that trimming off the fat will fit well in my diet.
I found 16 lbs of Pork Butt (Shoulder) at Costco. Only when I got home did I realize that it might have been a bit of overkill. I put half in the freezer for some other adventure.</description>
