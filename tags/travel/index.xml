      <description>I got a subscription to Bon App√©tit recently because I spent some money at Sur la Table. I really like the magazine, especially the fact that they concentrate all the featured recipes at the back of the issue. That&amp;rsquo;s nice because you can just cut stuff out there.
They had a feature about what to pack if you have to go cook somewhere. I liked the list and I want to keep it for myself on the public internet.</description>
