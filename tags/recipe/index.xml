      <description>Andy&amp;rsquo;s one of my best friends. He&amp;rsquo;s also a Vietnamese guy. He makes delicious dishes and during our time as roommates, he expanded my knowledge of ingredients. He introduced me to fish sauce and it&amp;rsquo;s role in savory dishes. Also, how it should never be left to roll around in the back of your car.
 Ingredient Quantity     Chicken Breast, Roasted    10 oz      Butter, Salted    1 Tablespoon      Onion, Chopped    1 Medium      Sugar (optional)    1 Teaspoon      Fish Sauce    2 Tablespoons      Better than Bullion, Chicken    1 Tablespoon      Okra, Sliced, Wheels    40 Pods      Cilantro    Handfull      Green Onion, Chopped    Handfull      Water / Chicken Broth    Lots      Start by frying your pan ingredients together in the bottom of a heavy pot.</description>

      <title>Roasted Bird&#39;s Eye Chili Powder</title>

      <description>Fuck yo tongue.
 Ingredient Quantity     Chilies    Tub `O      Break the ends off the chilies and throw away any mushy or moldy ones. Lovingly slice them in half lengthwise. You could take the time to seed them, but that kinda defeats the purpose of making your own ridiculously hot crushed peppers.
Use gloves if you like to touch yourself.</description>

      <title>Overnight Pizza Dough</title>

      <description>Basics with Babish did pizza dough this week. I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting for Sunday all week because of that.
He mentions that the recipe is Jim Lahey&amp;rsquo;s overnight pizza dough. The recipe looks super simple and I love the fact that everything is listed in grams. Baking is science and that&amp;rsquo;s usually why I don&amp;rsquo;t do it. I don&amp;rsquo;t really like following directions in the kitchen, but I can make an exception for pizza.</description>

      <title>Chicken Legs (Wing Style)</title>

      <description>I spend a lot of time thinking about protein. I get about 120g per day which is almost the minimum for my weight. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen articles recommending 1-1.5g of protein per pound of bodyweight when you&amp;rsquo;re active. Because I weigh 244lbs (today), and my goal is 200lbs, I think I should just target the goal weight quantity.
So, let&amp;rsquo;s do some chicken this week. That&amp;rsquo;ll help right? Of course, Kenji&amp;rsquo;s got me covered.</description>

      <description>That mini-muffin pan is one of the best weight-loss buys I&amp;rsquo;ve made. 24 little slots to fill with goodness. I haven&amp;rsquo;t ever used it for muffins though. Because muffins suck. Meatballs win every time.
These things are fun too. Some eggs and some low cal sausage and you have little breakfast party bites that run about 29 calories a pop.
Go get these things:
 Ingredient Quantity     Eggs    4      Egg Whites    4      Red Bell Pepper    1      Mushrooms    11      Green Onions    6ish?</description>

      <description>Kenji seems to have superpowers. I like everything I&amp;rsquo;ve made with his guidance, and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that this is no exception. I love me some carnitas and I think that trimming off the fat will fit well in my diet.
I found 16 lbs of Pork Butt (Shoulder) at Costco. Only when I got home did I realize that it might have been a bit of overkill. I put half in the freezer for some other adventure.</description>

      <description>This is my standard Gumbo. Alton Brown posted a recipe for inspiration, but I really just do whatever I feel like. I feel like I can deviate a bit because I don&amp;rsquo;t have a Bayou Grandma to yell at me. I&amp;rsquo;m not about to go hunting for filè powder when I&amp;rsquo;m cooking for the week.
 Ingredient Quantity     Flour, Wheat, All Purpose    4 Tablespoons      Butter, Salted    4 Tablespoons      Onion, Yellow, Chopped    1 Cup      Garlic, Clove, Halved    6      Peppers, Bell, Medium, Diced    2      Celery, Diced    1 Cup      Red Chili Flakes    some      Granulated Garlic    some      Cumin    some      Celery Salt    some      Black Pepper    lots      Smoked Paprika    some      Stock, Chicken    2 Cups      Tomatos, Diced, No Salt    4 Cups      Okra, Wheels    4 Cups      Basil Leaves    12      Make your roux first with the red ingredients.</description>
