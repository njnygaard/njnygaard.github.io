      <description>Glad I found this one in my drafts and completed the photos. We had a lot of fun camping out there. A little cold but I bought a quilted thermal jacket and some wool socks from Walmart that really seemed to take the edge off.
Not much of an interesting elevation profile from the GPS, but I think I was just experimenting with it then. This was a car camping trip so we just did some wandering and we drove both ways.</description>
