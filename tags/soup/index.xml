      <description>Andy&amp;rsquo;s one of my best friends. He&amp;rsquo;s also a Vietnamese guy. He makes delicious dishes and during our time as roommates, he expanded my knowledge of ingredients. He introduced me to fish sauce and it&amp;rsquo;s role in savory dishes. Also, how it should never be left to roll around in the back of your car.

      <description>This is my standard Gumbo. Alton Brown posted a recipe for inspiration, but I really just do whatever I feel like. I feel like I can deviate a bit because I don&amp;rsquo;t have a Bayou Grandma to yell at me. I&amp;rsquo;m not about to go hunting for fil√® powder when I&amp;rsquo;m cooking for the week.
 Ingredient Quantity     Flour, Wheat, All Purpose    4 Tablespoons      Butter, Salted    4 Tablespoons      Onion, Yellow, Chopped    1 Cup      Garlic, Clove, Halved    6      Peppers, Bell, Medium, Diced    2      Celery, Diced    1 Cup      Red Chili Flakes    some      Granulated Garlic    some      Cumin    some      Celery Salt    some      Black Pepper    lots      Smoked Paprika    some      Stock, Chicken    2 Cups      Tomatoes, Diced, No Salt    4 Cups      Okra, Wheels    4 Cups      Basil Leaves    12      Make your roux first with the red ingredients.</description>
