      <description>This is just a classic. I would hesitate to call this a recipe and really more of a &amp;lsquo;method&amp;rsquo;. This is really about getting as much beef in your mouth as you can and extending that experience with potatoes and carrots.
Ingredient Quantity Butter 4 Tablespoons Beef, Chuck 4lbs whole Baking Powder 1 Tablespoon, For Dusting Onion, White 1 Large Celery 3 Large Stalks Garlic 1 Head, All Cloves Carrots 2 Large Carrots 3 Large Little Potatoes 20 Small Bay Leaves 4 Fresh Soy Sauce 1/4 Cup Apple Cider Vinegar 2 Tablespoons Thyme Lots of sprigs Chipotle Chiles 2 Tomato Paste 2 Tablespoons Bone Broth 1 Quart Wine 1 Cup Fire Roasted Canned Diced Tomatoes 2 14oz Cans Instant Pot 1 Procedure Firstly, let your beef come to room temperature.</description>

      <description>This is my standard Gumbo. Alton Brown posted a recipe for inspiration, but I really just do whatever I feel like. I feel like I can deviate a bit because I don&amp;rsquo;t have a Bayou Grandma to yell at me. I&amp;rsquo;m not about to go hunting for fil√® powder when I&amp;rsquo;m cooking for the week.
Ingredient Quantity Flour, Wheat, All Purpose 4 Tablespoons Butter, Salted 4 Tablespoons Onion, Yellow, Chopped 1 Cup Garlic, Clove, Halved 6 Peppers, Bell, Medium, Diced 2 Celery, Diced 1 Cup Red Chili Flakes some Granulated Garlic some Cumin some Celery Salt some Black Pepper lots Smoked Paprika some Stock, Chicken 2 Cups Tomatoes, Diced, No Salt 4 Cups Okra, Wheels 4 Cups Basil Leaves 12 Make your roux first with the red ingredients.</description>
