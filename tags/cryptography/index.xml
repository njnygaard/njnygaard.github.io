      <description>Keybase has a great feature called kbfs. You get 10 Gigs of storage forever. They say that it will be free going forward, and I would like to believe them because I don&amp;rsquo;t think Keybase will ever really be popular. I would love to eat those words.
They mention that you should not expect your files to be resilient; this is an Alpha service, so there is no guarantee of safety.</description>
