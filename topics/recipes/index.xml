      <description>Ash has been wanting these for 2 months. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t say no when we were going to be using the Traeger anyways.
 Ingredient Quantity     Jalapeños    18 Medium      Thin-Cut Bacon    1 Pack      Cream Cheese    8-10 Oz (room temperature)      Colby Jack    4 Oz      Chili Powder    1 tsp      Granulated Garlic    1 tsp      Salt    1 tsp      Scallions    2 minced      Procedure Split the jalapeños lengthwise.</description>

      <title>Bone Broth</title>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t really like the distinction between &amp;lsquo;bone broth&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;stock&amp;rsquo; because they&amp;rsquo;re the same thing if done right. The distinction is useful because the product that is called stock in a grocery store is very different. Useful, but different.
Bone broth is gelatinous at fridge temperature. This is because you cook down the bones and connective tissue over a long period of time. Collagen is converted to gelatin and you get meat/bone jello.</description>

      <description>Serious Eats is becoming my go-to for food articles. I&amp;rsquo;ll immediately check for results from them when I need a standard technique. Kenji does a great job of testing. Even things as simple as boiled eggs.
 Ingredient Quantity     Boneless Skinless Chicken Breast    ~ 6 Breasts      Kosher Salt    80g      White Granulated Sugar    25g      Water    2L      Big Bowl    2      These measurements differ from the ones in the article because I found the resultant breasts to be too sweet.</description>

      <description>Fuck yo tongue.
 Ingredient Quantity     Chilies    Tub `O      Break the ends off the chilies and throw away any mushy or moldy ones. Lovingly slice them in half lengthwise. You could take the time to seed them, but that kinda defeats the purpose of making your own ridiculously hot crushed peppers.
Use gloves if you like to touch yourself.</description>

      <title>Overnight Pizza Dough</title>

      <description>Basics with Babish did pizza dough this week. I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting for Sunday all week because of that.
He mentions that the recipe is Jim Lahey&amp;rsquo;s overnight pizza dough. The recipe looks super simple and I love the fact that everything is listed in grams. Baking is science and that&amp;rsquo;s usually why I don&amp;rsquo;t do it. I don&amp;rsquo;t really like following directions in the kitchen, but I can make an exception for pizza.</description>

      <title>Chicken Legs (Wing Style)</title>

      <description>I spend a lot of time thinking about protein. I get about 120g per day which is almost the minimum for my weight. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen articles recommending 1-1.5g of protein per pound of bodyweight when you&amp;rsquo;re active. Because I weigh 244lbs (today), and my goal is 200lbs, I think I should just target the goal weight quantity.
So, let&amp;rsquo;s do some chicken this week. That&amp;rsquo;ll help right? Of course, Kenji&amp;rsquo;s got me covered.</description>

      <description>That mini-muffin pan is one of the best weight-loss buys I&amp;rsquo;ve made. 24 little slots to fill with goodness. I haven&amp;rsquo;t ever used it for muffins though. Because muffins suck. Meatballs win every time.
These things are fun too. Some eggs and some low cal sausage and you have little breakfast party bites that run about 29 calories a pop.
Go get these things:
 Ingredient Quantity     Eggs    4      Egg Whites    4      Red Bell Pepper    1      Mushrooms    11      Green Onions    6ish?</description>

      <description>Ingredient Quantity     Tomatillos    6      Jalapeños    3      Garlic    5 Cloves      Onion    1/2 Large      Pork Juice    Whatever you got      This salsa comes from the desire to use the rendered pork juices from the carnitas.</description>

      <description>Kenji seems to have superpowers. I like everything I&amp;rsquo;ve made with his guidance, and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that this is no exception. I love me some carnitas and I think that trimming off the fat will fit well in my diet.
I found 16 lbs of Pork Butt (Shoulder) at Costco. Only when I got home did I realize that it might have been a bit of overkill. I put half in the freezer for some other adventure.</description>

      <description>This is my standard Gumbo. Alton Brown posted a recipe for inspiration, but I really just do whatever I feel like. I feel like I can deviate a bit because I don&amp;rsquo;t have a Bayou Grandma to yell at me. I&amp;rsquo;m not about to go hunting for filè powder when I&amp;rsquo;m cooking for the week.
 Ingredient Quantity     Flour, Wheat, All Purpose    4 Tablespoons      Butter, Salted    4 Tablespoons      Onion, Yellow, Chopped    1 Cup      Garlic, Clove, Halved    6      Peppers, Bell, Medium, Diced    2      Celery, Diced    1 Cup      Red Chili Flakes    some      Granulated Garlic    some      Cumin    some      Celery Salt    some      Black Pepper    lots      Smoked Paprika    some      Stock, Chicken    2 Cups      Tomatos, Diced, No Salt    4 Cups      Okra, Wheels    4 Cups      Basil Leaves    12      Make your roux first with the red ingredients.</description>

      <description>Basics with Babish inspired me to make some stock.
 Ingredient     Chicken Spines and Wings      White Onions      Oil      Celery      Carrots      Leeks      Parsnips      Turnips      Garlic (entire head)      Fresh Thyme      Fresh Parsley      Whole Peppercorns      Tasty Water      Brown the red ingredients in your stock pot.</description>
