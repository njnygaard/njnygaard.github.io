      <description>First post of the New Year. Still got it in January. I moved States, bought a house, got a dog. So blogging has not been at the top of the list.
Now that I emptied my storage unit, I found my old buddy Tinman. He&amp;rsquo;s a Core i7 &amp;lsquo;server&amp;rsquo; with two GTX 480&amp;rsquo;s and 2TB of space. He&amp;rsquo;s old, but sturdy. He deserves a place of glory. And and Arch installation.</description>

      <title>Questions in Arch</title>

      <description>I notice myself asking questions about common tasks when I come back to Arch after a long time. I think that makes for a good article as it is possible others have these questions.
I&amp;rsquo;m running out of space and that&amp;rsquo;s stupid.
Not a question, but I&amp;rsquo;ve felt that exact sentiment.
In Arch, this is very likely the Pacman cache going crazy. Every time you upgrade a package in Pacman, it keeps the previous version.</description>

      <description>I have trouble sometimes navigating network connectivity using Arch. The OS doesn&amp;rsquo;t really have an issue getting out to networks, I just seem to not remember what to do in a time of need. Unfortunately, it is usually the first thing you need to do to begin the problem solving process.
It is not lost on me that I am posting this article on the Internet. You&amp;rsquo;ll find it after you get in to trouble.</description>

      <title>Connecting to Unsecured Networks</title>

      <description>This seems to be a bit of a nightmare with Arch. I think the issue is that it is difficult to test. I typically connect to pretty good networks that have passwords and reasonable security. On vacation though, I don&amp;rsquo;t have a choice of what to connect to. I really don&amp;rsquo;t know what the advantage of WPA Enterprise is with the stupid login page. There is no way that is more secure.</description>

      <description>Before going on, make sure you meet the requirements:
General recommendations after an Arch install can be found here. I&amp;rsquo;m going to use this article to collect my list of requirements.
Okay, you have to install sudo. You also need a user. And a sudo group. Use visudo to edit the sudoers file. groupadd sudo will add the sudo group. Then you can gpasswd -a drone sudo to add drone to the sudo group.</description>

      <title>Installing Arch</title>

      <description>I wanted to install Arch because all the cool kids do it. Really, what I wanted was more control over the system and the decisions I had to make to get it to work. In the past, I have favored speed of installation and stability of the installation because I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to spend time configuring stuff that didn&amp;rsquo;t relate to what I wanted to accomplish. That basically means LTS Ubuntu.</description>
