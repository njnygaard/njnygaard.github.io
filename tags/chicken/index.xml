      <description>Serious Eats is becoming my go-to for food articles. I&amp;rsquo;ll immediately check for results from them when I need a standard technique. Kenji does a great job of testing. Even things as simple as boiled eggs.
Ingredient Quantity Boneless Skinless Chicken Breast ~ 6 Breasts Kosher Salt 80g White Granulated Sugar 25g Water 2L Big Bowl 2 These measurements differ from the ones in the article because I found the resultant breasts to be too sweet.</description>

      <description>Andy&amp;rsquo;s one of my best friends. He&amp;rsquo;s also a Vietnamese guy. He makes delicious dishes and during our time as roommates, he expanded my knowledge of ingredients. He introduced me to fish sauce and it&amp;rsquo;s role in savory dishes. Also, how it should never be left to roll around in the back of your car.
Ingredient Quantity Chicken Breast, Roasted 10 oz Butter, Salted 1 Tablespoon Onion, Chopped 1 Medium Sugar (optional) 1 Teaspoon Fish Sauce 2 Tablespoons Better than Bullion, Chicken 1 Tablespoon Okra, Sliced, Wheels 40 Pods Cilantro Handful Green Onion, Chopped Handful Water / Chicken Broth Lots Start by frying your pan ingredients together in the bottom of a heavy pot.</description>

      <description>I spend a lot of time thinking about protein. I get about 120g per day which is almost the minimum for my weight. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen articles recommending 1-1.5g of protein per pound of bodyweight when you&amp;rsquo;re active. Because I weigh 244lbs (today), and my goal is 200lbs, I think I should just target the goal weight quantity.
So, let&amp;rsquo;s do some chicken this week. That&amp;rsquo;ll help right? Of course, Kenji&amp;rsquo;s got me covered.</description>

      <description>This is my standard Gumbo. Alton Brown posted a recipe for inspiration, but I really just do whatever I feel like. I feel like I can deviate a bit because I don&amp;rsquo;t have a Bayou Grandma to yell at me. I&amp;rsquo;m not about to go hunting for fil√® powder when I&amp;rsquo;m cooking for the week.
Ingredient Quantity Flour, Wheat, All Purpose 4 Tablespoons Butter, Salted 4 Tablespoons Onion, Yellow, Chopped 1 Cup Garlic, Clove, Halved 6 Peppers, Bell, Medium, Diced 2 Celery, Diced 1 Cup Red Chili Flakes some Granulated Garlic some Cumin some Celery Salt some Black Pepper lots Smoked Paprika some Stock, Chicken 2 Cups Tomatoes, Diced, No Salt 4 Cups Okra, Wheels 4 Cups Basil Leaves 12 Make your roux first with the red ingredients.</description>
