      <description>This was a wonderful experiment for the 113Â°F Phoenix summer. My FiL got an automated garden for Christmas and has been growing mint like crazy. He warned me about it taking over my raised planter and I dismissed that because I love mint. Naturally, it took over half of it and had to be dealt with. I harvested half of it which yielded 250g of mint leaves. In retrospect, I could easily have doubled the mint quantity in this recipe.</description>
