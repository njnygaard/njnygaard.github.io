      <title>Running I3</title>

      <description>I wanted to switch to i3, a tiling window manager. There are some things that are better, and some things that I miss. I run Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Unity provides a lot of functionality that makes using the computer effortless. The motivation for using i3 is that, while developing, I end up tiling all my windows in separate workspaces anyways. It seems like the natural functionality of i3 better fits my use-case.</description>

      <title>AWS Instance Resiliency</title>

      <description>I recently discovered that changing the size of and EC2 instance does not destroy the EBS volume associated with it. Let that sink in. You have a computer sitting on your desk serving your website. You realize that you&amp;rsquo;re spending too much money on electricity for this computer, so while it is running, you rip the hard drive out and put it in another computer. In 5 seconds, your website is still running.</description>

      <title>Wordpress TLS</title>
      <link>https://www.nygaard.site/post/0007-wordpress-tls/</link>

      <description>Background I needed to get a Wordpress site working for my side project. The installation process is all fine and dandy, until you want to do the right thing and enforce TLS for your site. I ran in to issues with mixed-content errors. Wordpress was requesting jQuery and some CSS files over the insecure routes to my domain.
Attempted Solutions I had a redirect block in my nginx configuration, but that did not seem to solve the issue.</description>

      <description>I interviewed today with LinkedIn and [REDACTED]. He was intimidatingly knowledgeable and described a work environment that I really hope to join. I hope that I have the skill set necessary.
What follows are notes of the responses for my edification, not necessarily how I answered.
 Describe what happens when we type ssh shell.linkedin.com and hit enter.
  When you hit enter, your shell gets the string you entered on the command line.</description>

      <title>SSH Review</title>

      <description>Detail and SSH connection Symmetrical Encryption  One key can be used to encrypt messages Alice-&amp;gt;Bob but can also be used to decrypt messages Bob-&amp;gt;Alice. Anyone that holds the key, can encrypt and decrypt messages. AKA &amp;ldquo;Shared Secret&amp;rdquo; || &amp;ldquo;Secret Key&amp;rdquo; SSH uses Symmetrical encryption for the connection contrary to what most people believe (asymmetric). Asymmetric encryption is only used for authentication. Key Exchange Algorithm  Using an algorithm, the client and server can exchange data over the Asymmetrically encrypted connection to arrive at a shared secret that can be used for the Symmetrically Encrypted connection.</description>

      <description>Hey hey! I got it to work! I&amp;rsquo;ll use this post to log what I had to do to get it to work.
Motivation I wanted a site for my personal use. I started off with a full stack deployed on AWS, but when your trial runs out, you can get hit with a pretty hefty usage.
 
That&amp;rsquo;s quite a bit of money for something that I really wanted as a note store.</description>
