      <description>Keybase has a great feature called kbfs. You get 10 Gigs of storage forever. They say that it will be free going forward, and I would like to believe them because I don&amp;rsquo;t think Keybase will ever really be popular. I would love to eat those words.
They mention that you should not expect your files to be resilient; this is an Alpha service, so there is no guarantee of safety.</description>

      <description>Okay this is my first foray in to AppleScript, and I have to say that I don&amp;rsquo;t hate it. I wanted a way to take screenshots directly in to Preview on my Mac.
Turns out that the screenshot utility is available on the command line:
&amp;gt; screencapture -h screencapture: illegal option -- h usage: screencapture [-icMPmwsWxSCUtoa] [files] -c force screen capture to go to the clipboard -b capture Touch Bar - non-interactive modes only .</description>
