      <description>I wanted to test my application and I realized that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t organized in a testable fashion. My main function did a bunch of environment configuration that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t replicate in my tests. Stuff like configure clients for Elasticsearch, Redis, SendGrid, and most importantly, MySQL.
I use MySQL to store my user credentials, organizations (user groups), and roles. As an aside, organizations are separate entities, and roles are relations between users and organizations.</description>
