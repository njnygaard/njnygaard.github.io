# Testing Markdown Syntax
I'd like to know what kind of things I can do with this blog.  
The following is a list:  
- Item 1
- Item A
	* Another thing.
		+ More
	* Other things.
	
1. Numbered list
1. Similarly numbered list.
	1. Imbedded List
	1. Spelling mistake
		1. Another spelling mistake.
		

```bash
echo "I love you" >> ~/.ssh/config
```

```go
import (
	"idiocy"
	"log"
)
func func main() {
	log.println("Almost good.")
}
```

This has some inline code `()=>{console.log("This is code too..")}`

This is a table:

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
