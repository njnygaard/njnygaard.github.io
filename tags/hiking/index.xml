      <description>I proposed to my wife in Kauai at the Waimea Canyon Lookout. I couldn&#39;t have picked a better spot. Actually, I did. When we did the hike I picked the first spot you see here. You can see in the Google Earth picture the more teal trace as it curve along the rim. These two pictures are of that first spot. The &amp;lsquo;real&amp;rsquo; spot.
       However, in the following two, you can see the &amp;lsquo;real real&amp;rsquo; spot.</description>

      <description>This is Convict Lake. I grew coming here to hike and camp. My two fondest birthday celebrations have been at this lake. The first with my parents for my 12th birthday. The second with my parents and now wife for my 35th birthday.</description>
