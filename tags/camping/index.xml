      <description>Glad I found this one in my drafts and completed the photos. We had a lot of fun camping out there. A little cold but I bought a quilted thermal jacket and some wool socks from Walmart that really seemed to take the edge off.
Not much of an interesting elevation profile from the GPS, but I think I was just experimenting with it then. This was a car camping trip so we just did some wandering and we drove both ways.</description>

      <description>This is Convict Lake. I grew coming here to hike and camp. My two fondest birthday celebrations have been at this lake. The first with my parents for my 12th birthday. The second with my parents and now wife for my 35th birthday.

This hike only takes a couple hours or so. It is nothing too strenuous, just a nice loop around the lake. That purple area extends further in to the mountain during summer.</description>
